My name is Katya. 
I am a student. In two years I will become a teacher of biology. 
My profession is my hobby as well. I visit the bookstores of my town regularly and buy new books in biology. 
It helps me to learn all the novelties in my profession I often discuss the books that I have bought, 
with my friends at the university When I go shopping, I buy not only books, but also some other things, that I need.
I live in Dnepropetrovsk. It is a large city. There are a lot of shops here. 
If I go shopping, it is not easy for me to choose the right place at once. 
I am fond of fashion and always try to buy new clothes in order to look fashionable and attractive. It is not an easy task. 
I have to try on a lot of dresses, skirts and blouses till I choose what I really like. If I need a dress for a special occasion, 
I go to a shop with my best friend Olya. She is always ready to help me and I try to follow her advice.
Sometimes Olya and I go shopping just for fun. We walk along the streets, 
visit different kinds of shops and buy some trifles that raise our mood. 
We may buy something tasty and organize a small party for our friends. 
I should say that shopping is my hobby, It is the best treatment for me when I am in a bad mood.
